Sample input file for GB calculation using GBNSR6 model
#This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. 
Although, we tried to use the input files as recommended in the
#Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform 
more expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of time. 
Feel free to change the parameters #according to what is better 
for your system.
