# Protein-ligand binding free energy calculations (Single Trajectory method)
In this case, gmx_MMPBSA requires:

* An input parameters file (*.in) -- input file containing all the specifications regarding the type of calculation that
is going to be performed
* The MD Structure+mass(db) file (*.tpr, *.pdb, *.gro) 
* An index file (*.ndx) -- *.ndx file containing the receptor and ligand in separated groups
* Receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file
* A trajectory file (*.xtc, *.pdb, *.gro, *.trr) -- final Gromacs MD trajectory, fitted and with no pbc.

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/GMX-MMPBSA#calling-gmx_mmpbsa-from-the-command-line)_

That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

    gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc -lm ligand.mol2

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

```
Sample input file for GB calculation
&general
startframe=5, endframe=20, verbose=2,
protein_forcefield=3, ligand_forcefield=1
/
&gb
igb=5, saltcon=0.150,
/
```

_See a detailed list of all the options in gmx_MMPBSA input file [here](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/GMX-MMPBSA#the-input-file) 
as well as several [examples](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/GMX-MMPBSA#sample-input-files)_

In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and 
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, a MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.tpr`), an index file (`index.ndx`),
a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file (`1 13`) are needed.
A ligand .mol2 file is also needed for generating the ligand topology. The `mmpbsa.in` input file will contain all the 
parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. In this case, 16 frames `(endframe-startframe)/interval = (21-5)/1 = 16`
are going to be used when performing the the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation with the igb5 (GB-OBC2) model and a 
salt concentration = 0.15M.
